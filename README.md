# IMDB_Movies_NLP

Over the last two decades, social media's popularity has increased tremendously. Everybody uses social media in their everyday life to express their thoughts and opinions about a range of subjects. Many companies process the data and utilize it to generate pertinent information that they may later use for business goals. There is a considerable quantity of text-based data on movie reviews that the public provides on websites like IMDB, Amazon, Rotten Tomatoes, and others, and manually analyzing that data is a challenging job. To tackle this problem and make the process simple and automated, sentiment analysis is used. The Sentimental analysis is a subfield of Natural Language Processing and AI, used for extracting meaningful information from the textual data which we can utilize further to improve business in all way.

In this project, I have taken dataset of IMDB movie reviews to predict how the audience have rated the movies and predict the movies that have a positive or negative review. I will create a model which I will used for extracting information using Sentiment Analysis from the data and predict which classifier is best suitable for this dataset by looking at the accuracy.
